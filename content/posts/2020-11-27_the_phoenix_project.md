Dear reader,

This post is the start of a series where I will recap some of the best books I have read.
I will write about a variety of topics such as: Software Engineering, DevOps, Distributed Systems, Business, Management, Psychology, Math, Philosophy and Physics.

To start this series, I would like to talk about a book that taught me a lot about the principles of DevOps and introduced me to the world of IT management.
I talk about the infamous book "The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win" by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford.\
So, what makes this book so incredibly good and why should you bother reading it?
