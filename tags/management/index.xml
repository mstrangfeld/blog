      <description>Dear reader,
This post is the start of a series where I will recap some of the best books I have read. I will write about a variety of topics such as: Software Engineering, DevOps, Distributed Systems, Business, Management, Psychology, Math, Philosophy and Physics.
To start this series, I would like to talk about a book that taught me a lot about the principles of DevOps and introduced me to the world of IT management.</description>
